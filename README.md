# TekSystemsExercise

I had figured out the bugs fixed them and wanted to make the objects self sufficeient so changed the project a bit as It is a better approach.

Suggrestion:

The total in each order is calculated excluding salesTax

i.e, OrderTotal += itemPrice; Wrong in real time

OrderTotal += itemPrice + salesTax;
